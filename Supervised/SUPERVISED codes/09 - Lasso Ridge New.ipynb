    "Let's go through each of the components in detail:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize the LassoRegression class**:\n",
    "   - In the `__init__` method, we initialize the LassoRegression class with parameters such as `alpha`, `iterations`, and `tol`.\n",
    "   - `alpha` represents the regularization parameter (lambda) in Lasso regression, controlling the strength of regularization.\n",
    "   - `iterations` specifies the maximum number of iterations for gradient descent.\n",
    "   - `tol` is the tolerance for convergence, defining the threshold for stopping the gradient descent loop when the changes in coefficients become small enough.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Define the soft_thresholding_operator method**:\n",
    "   - The `soft_thresholding_operator` method implements the soft thresholding operator, which is a key step in the Lasso regression algorithm.\n",
    "   - It takes a vector `x` and a regularization parameter `lambda_` as input.\n",
    "   - It applies the soft thresholding function to each element of the vector `x`, returning the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Implement the fit method**:\n",
    "   - The `fit` method performs gradient descent to update the coefficients and intercept of the Lasso regression model.\n",
    "   - It takes input features `X` and target values `y`.\n",
    "   - It initializes the coefficients and intercept, and then iteratively updates them using gradient descent until convergence or reaching the maximum number of iterations.\n",
    "   - During each iteration, it computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to the coefficients and intercept, and updates them accordingly using the soft thresholding operator.\n",
    "   - It stops the loop when the changes in coefficients become smaller than the specified tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Implement the predict method**:\n",
    "   - The `predict` method computes predictions based on the fitted Lasso regression model.\n",
    "   - It takes input features `X` and returns the predicted target values based on the computed coefficients and intercept.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Example usage**:\n",
    "   - In the example usage section, we create an instance of the `LassoRegression` class with a specified `alpha` value.\n",
    "   - We then fit the model to sample data `X` and `y` using the `fit` method.\n",
    "   - After fitting the model, we make predictions on new data `X_test` using the `predict` method.\n",
    "   - Finally, we print the predicted values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this detailed explanation provides insights into each component of the Lasso regression implementation, from initialization to prediction, demonstrating the core logic of the algorithm."
